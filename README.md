# Neighborhood Matchmaker

Neighborhood Matchmaker is a web application that helps users find the best neighborhoods based on their lifestyle preferences. Users input criteria such as budget, commute time, preference for quiet or lively areas, and access to amenities. The app then returns the top 5 neighborhoods that best match these preferences by pulling data from open APIs.
